DataSync is an executable Java application which serves as a general solution to automate publishing data on the Socrata platform. It can be used through a easy-to-use graphical interface or as a command-line tool ('headless mode'). Whether you are a non-technical user, developer, or ETL specialist DataSync makes data publishing simple and reliable. DataSync takes a CSV or TSV file on a local machine or networked hard drive and publishes it to a Socrata dataset so that the Socrata dataset stays up-to-date. DataSync jobs can be integrated into an ETL process, scheduled using a tool such as the Windows Task Scheduler or Cron, or used to perform updates or deletes in batches. DataSync works on any platform that runs Java version 7 (a.k.a version 1.7) or higher (i.e. Windows, Mac, and Linux). This simple, yet powerful publishing tool lets you easily update Socrata datasets programmatically and automatically (scheduled), without writing a single line of code.
